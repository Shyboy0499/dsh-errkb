// Machine-local state: `state.json` in the knowledge base directory (§4.3).
//
// ERRORS.md is append-only knowledge, shared across devices through git: a
// block is written once and rewritten only when someone edits its fix, status
// or notes. What changes on every repeat of an error - its hit count and when
// it was last seen - lives here instead, so two devices that both hit the same
// error never touch the same block and their histories merge cleanly. The file
// is machine-local and never committed; the counts may differ between devices,
// only the knowledge has to agree.
//
// The Hits and Last seen written in a block are its baseline: 1 and the time
// of creation, or whatever a human typed there. The effective values everyone
// shows are the baseline plus this machine's delta, and the later of the two
// times (effectiveEntry()). Deleting state.json is therefore harmless: the
// counts fall back to the baselines.
//
// Shape (version 1):
//
//   { "version": 1,
//     "entries": { "E-0007": { "hits": 3, "lastSeen": "2026-09-14 09:12" } },
//     "trust": { "E-0007": { "injected": 2, "recurredAfterInject": 0,
//                            "succeeded": 1, "fixSig": "…" } } }
//
// `entries` is keyed by entry ID, which never changes. `trust` holds FixTrust's
// records (inject.ts, docs/discussions.md §4), also per ID.
//
// A missing file is an empty state. A file that is not JSON, or not version 1,
// reads as empty too and never throws; it is left alone until the next write,
// which saves it aside as `state.corrupt-<ts>.json` before replacing it - the
// same treatment ERRORS.md gets. A record of the wrong shape inside a valid
// file is dropped on its own.
//
// Writes take the knowledge base's `.lock`, the same one the store takes, and
// replace the file atomically (temp file + rename). The recorder also runs them
// on its per-knowledge-base write chain, so within one process they are
// serialized anyway; the lock is for two processes (a web and a headless
// harness) on one machine, which would otherwise lose increments to each
// other's read-modify-write.
//
// Like store.ts, the logic takes its machine as an argument: the filesystem
// and the clock are injected.
