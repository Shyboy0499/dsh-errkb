// Resolution detection (T14): noticing that an error the knowledge base knows
// about has stopped happening, so its fix can be trusted (§3 step 6) and, when
// none is recorded, asked for once (§7, the `captureFix` setting).
//
// Pure: no hooks, no store, no clock. src/plugin.ts feeds it what the
// `tools/result` hook sees and acts on what it reports.
//
// The rule. An entry is *watched* in a session once a tool call there was
// recorded against it - appended as a new entry, or counted as a hit, which
// includes every hit whose fix was injected. The watch names a key: the
// command line for a non-zero exit (`command-exit`), the tool name for a tool
// failure. A later successful call on the same key, in the same session and
// inside the window, *resolves* the entry.
//
// The window is the rest of the turn the entry was last recorded in plus the
// whole next turn ({@link RESOLUTION_WINDOW_TURNS}). A fix normally lands in
// the same turn; the next turn covers "fix it, and the user re-runs it". Any
// later success is too far from the failure to say anything about it, so the
// watch lapses.
//
// Recurrence. Every new recording of the entry replaces its watch: the window
// starts again from the recurrence, and the key becomes the one that failed
// last. So a success that only follows an older occurrence - the entry failed
// on tool A, then again on tool B, then A succeeded - resolves nothing; a
// success on B afterwards does.
//
// The model's free text is never parsed for a fix: `err_record` (T15), through
// the recorder's recordFix(), is the only way one is written.
